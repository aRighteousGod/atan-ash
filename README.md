# Ash

Adds ash and ash processing.

Burning chemical fuel produces ash that must be removed or it will eventually backup the machine.

Ash has a stack size of 100.

Ash can be processed into more useful items:

* Researching [Landfill](https://wiki.factorio.com/Landfill_(research)) unlocks assembling machine recipe: 0.5 s + 500 ash → 1 landfill
* Researching [Advanced material processing 2](https://wiki.factorio.com/Advanced_material_processing_2_(research)) unlocks electric furnace recipe: 3.2 s + 20 ash → 1 stone brick
* Researching [Automation 3](https://wiki.factorio.com/Automation_3_(research)) unlocks assembling machine recipe: 1 s + 10 ash → (50% × 1 coal) + (5% × 1 iron ore)

These recipes can not be hand crafted. The recipe unlocked with Automation 3 may use productivity modules.

A setting is provided to enable trees and biters to drop ash as loot when they die from fire damage.

## Space Age support

If you are playing with Space Age, these additional recipes are added:

* Researching [Biochamber](https://wiki.factorio.com/Biochamber_(research)) unlocks biochamber recipe: 4 s + 20 ash + 50 water → 2 nutrients
* Researching [Foundation](https://wiki.factorio.com/Foundation) unlocks assembling machine recipe: 30 s + 4 tungsten plate + 4 lithium plate + 4 carbon fiber + 200 ash + 20 fluoroketone (cold) → 1 foundation

## But why?

[Pyanodons Coal Processing](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pycoalprocessing) adds ash as a byproduct of burning chemical fuels. It's a fun mechanic, and I wished I could play with it without having to play with all the other added complexity of the Pyanodons suite. So I made this mod.
